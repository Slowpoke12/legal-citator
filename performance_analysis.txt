171 BB checks:
145 true positives (no error on correct citations) 
9 true negatives (caught correct mistake)
7 unexpected false negatives (3 distinct bugs)
10 expected false negatives (limits in the scope of the free case database and the scope of table 13�s list of non-law journal abbreviations).  

List of bugs:
Footnote 10: NW. J. INT�L L. & BUS.  =>need to figure out why ' != � and how to fix it.
Footnote 13:  Nw. J. Int�l L. & Bus.

Footnote 159: J.L. ECON. & POL�Y 
Footnote 161: Nw. J. Int�l L. & Bus.

Footnote 215: 15 (Apr. 27 => one of the (stunningly, amazingly few!!!) regex errors that collects a type of source just totally unrelated to the mission.  The whole source is 126 YALE L. J. FORUM 8, 15 (Apr. 27, 2016), and the program collects two possible cites�Yale L. J. Forum (correct); and 15 (Apr. 27 (incorrect!).  YLJ Forum is one of the few forums that requires days so this should not be a common bug, but this is probably an error that a more well-designed Regex code could ignore.
